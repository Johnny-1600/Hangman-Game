# Hangman Game

## Repository
(https://github.com/Johnny-1600/Hangman-Game.git)

## Description
This program will run a hangman game that I will personalize and make it my own, giving my own style to it.
I will implement different colors or variation of this game.

## Features
- Feature 1
	- It will show the parts of the "hangman" for every wrong letter.
- Feature 2
	- A win and lose text or screen.
- Feature 3
  - Contains variety of random words or phrases.
- Feature 4
   - Different art styles?

## Challenges
- Explore more of what pygame has to offer.
- Maybe import more libraries.
- Experimenting or Practicing more with the draw feature of pygame (getting better).

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The program will let user guess letters with keyboard input, then will show whether it was right or wrong.
- If wrong, a body part is added to the hangman, if right the word will appear on one of the spaces.
- Then display a win or losing text/screen.
- Be able to do different themes of hangman, ex.) animal as hangman, food as hangman, colors, fonts, drawing styles, etc.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- At least be able to allow user to input their guessed letters and show if it was right. And some way of showing if the letter guessed was wrong.
- And show different colors or art.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Implement a random function to implement the words that user will have to guess (will put a variety amount of words or phrases).
  2. Also implement the drawing function of the hangman and the fonts of letters.

- Week 2
  1. Will create a function that display number of tries left with spaces and body parts added.
  2. Also create it with a game loop so when game is done, it quits program.

- Week N (Final)
  1. After getting the barebones of program done, will start to make artistic changes to hangman.
  2. Create different themes which will have different hangman themes and also different font or color themes (that user can change).
