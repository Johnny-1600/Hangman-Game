## Description
  This Program runs a simple hang-man game. I stylized it to make it a little more interesting than just a simple hang-man game.
I added a dark theme and a light theme mode toggle button. I also added a button that allows the user to switch the colors of 
the game to make it more fun for the user to interact with. If the word is too hard for the user to guess, they can press the 'hint' button, 
which gives them one free guess to make it a little easier if they wish to use it. I also didn't make it fullscreen for the intent of 
being able to play it while doing other tasks on device and can be on the side to play with for a little fun distraction.

  I wanted to add more sprites to the stickman like to add a car or a guitar in place of the stickman but I didn't have time. I may go back in the future and add it,
but for how it now, is above the minimum for what I hoped to achieve. I like this little hang-man game and I am able to add onto it whenever I feel like coding.
My goal was to just make it clean and simple but also stylized to make it user friendly. Like I said, a little fun and simple hang-man game to enjoy.
